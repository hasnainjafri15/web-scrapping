# web-scrapping

This is the code for a web scrapping bot I have built using:
> Selenium;
> python;
> Google searches :p.

This bot:

1. Takes a list of keywords from a excel file.
2. Searches them on Daraz.pk - leading e-commerce website in Pakistan
3. Scrapes prices of top 20 products along with total number of items found for that keyword
4. Saves all that data into an excel file


This is a continous project that I am further working on. I plan to make it more extensive along with OOP functionalities. 

In the end, I would love to deploy it as web app/ chrome extension.
